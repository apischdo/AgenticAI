      "SON: I’d like to buy a small motorcycle. I’ve been researching safety courses and budgeting for gear, and I think I can handle it responsibly.\n",
      "MOTHER: I appreciate your research and responsibility, but I'm concerned about the injury risk associated with motorcycles, especially for new riders. Have you considered how much insurance would cost and how you plan to manage noise levels in our neighborhood? Maybe we could postpone the purchase until you've completed a safety course and created a solid budget plan.\n",
      "FATHER: I support your interest in getting a motorcycle, but we need to set some strong safety rules first. You must complete a mandatory safety course, wear full protective gear at all times, and limit your riding to certain areas until you gain more experience. Additionally, let's set a budget for your purchase and establish savings goals to ensure you're financially prepared. A curfew for riding would also be necessary to keep you safe.\n",
      "SON: I understand your concerns, and I’m committed to prioritizing safety. I plan to take a safety course and invest in quality gear to protect myself. I’ll also create a budget that includes insurance and savings for maintenance. I’m open to any conditions you think are necessary to ensure I’m responsible with this decision.\n",
      "MOTHER: I’m glad to hear you’re committed to safety and budgeting. Can you share more about the safety course you found and how you plan to manage the ongoing costs like insurance and maintenance? It might also be wise to consider postponing the purchase until you have a solid plan in place and some experience under your belt.\n",
      "FATHER: That sounds like a good plan, but let's make sure we have everything in place before you make a purchase. Once you complete the safety course and have your gear, we can discuss a budget that includes insurance and maintenance costs. Additionally, I want you to set a savings goal for a few months to show you can manage the financial responsibilities. We can also establish a curfew for your riding hours to keep you safe.\n",
      "SON: I appreciate your support and suggestions. I’ll make sure to complete the safety course and create a detailed budget that covers insurance and maintenance. I’ll also set a savings goal to demonstrate my commitment. I’m open to discussing a curfew for riding hours to ensure my safety and your peace of mind.\n",
      "MOTHER: That sounds like a responsible approach, and I’m glad you’re willing to take these steps. Once you complete the safety course and have your budget ready, let’s sit down together to review everything. This way, we can ensure you’re fully prepared and that we’re all comfortable with the decision before moving forward.\n",
      "FATHER: I agree with your plan, and I’m proud of your commitment to safety and responsibility. Once you have your safety course completed and your budget in place, let’s review it together. We can also discuss specific displacement limits for your motorcycle to ensure you’re not riding too far from home. This way, we can find a balance that keeps you safe while allowing you to enjoy your new bike.\n",
      "SON: Thank you for your understanding and support. I’ll focus on completing the safety course and preparing a detailed budget. I’ll also consider your suggestions about displacement limits and will keep you updated on my progress. I’m excited about this opportunity and appreciate your guidance in making it a responsible decision.\n",
      "FATHER: I’m glad to hear that, and I’m looking forward to seeing your progress. Just remember to keep safety as your top priority and communicate with us throughout the process. Once you have everything ready, we can finalize the details and make sure you’re set for a safe riding experience. Keep up the good work!\n"
