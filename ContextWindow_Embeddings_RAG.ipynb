    "# Lab: Chunking, Embeddings, and RAG with LlamaIndex + Ollama (Local Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a **long-ish text** and **chunk** it into smaller pieces.\n",
    "- Use an **embedding model** to represent those chunks as vectors.\n",
    "- Build a simple **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline:\n",
    "  - Retrieve the most relevant chunks using embeddings.\n",
    "  - Let a local LLM (via **Ollama**) generate an answer based on those chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything runs **locally** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ollama** for the LLM and (optionally) the embedding model.\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex** for chunking, indexing, and querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what **chunking** is and why it helps with context windows.\n",
    "- Explain what an **embedding** is and how it’s used for retrieval.\n",
    "- Understand how RAG adds **external knowledge** to an LLM.\n",

    "Before you run this notebook, ensure the following pre-requisites have met:\n",

    "1) Download from: https://ollama.com\n",
    "2) Double-click and invoke Ollama and ask a question to force it to download the required packages\n",

    "\n",
    "    ollama pull llama3\n",

    "   - A class reading,\n",
    "   - A web article (copied as plain text).\n",

    "- Does the answer from the RAG pipeline correctly reflect the content of your new document?\n",

    "1. In **Cell 3**, change `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, for example:\n",
    "   - Small chunks: `CHUNK_SIZE = 200`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP = 20`\n",

    "1. In **Cell 2**, keep the same `doc_text` but change `user_query` to questions like:\n",
    "   - \"What is an embedding and why is it useful?\"\n",
    "   - \"How does RAG reduce hallucinations in language models?\"\n",
    "   - \"What is the role of chunking in this system?\"\n",
